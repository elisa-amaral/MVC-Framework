# MVC Framework

This project is a Mode-View Controller Framework from the MVC Architecture coded in PHP and designed in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. A test database was coded in MySQL (MariaDB) to display some data through the MVC Framework. The home page is the ***/index*** route that
displays some product/price data stored in the test database, 
the ***/sample-page*** route displays fictional Company Mission/Vision/Values Statements, also retrieved from the test database.
